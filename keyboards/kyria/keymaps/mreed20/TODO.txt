- Move alt-tab shortcut to thumbs on non-default layer (like KC_ESC)

- Given a layer key TOG = LT(layer_x, KC_SOMEKEY), do I need to mark the
  location of TOG in layer_x as a No-op? I don't understand layers that well...

- don't use RGB (too much work)

- mouse keys

    - on their own layer? Or on the left side of navigation layer?
